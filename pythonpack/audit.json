This vulnerability has been disputed by the maintainers of pip as the described behavior is intended (although potentially insecure) and as such there are no plans to fix it. \n\nIf pip is executed with the `--extra-index-url` when using a private PyPI repository, an attacker could cause pip to download a private package (for example one named `private_package`) by adding a package with the same name (`private_package`) in the public PyPI repository. This would lead to remote code execution as pip will download the public package that could contain malicious code.

You can use pip to install packages from the Python Package Index and other indexes.\nAs part of a pip package installation, when extracting a source distribution (sdist), there is no check in place to make sure that paths of the archived files are not relative paths or don't contain [symbolic links](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_link) to files outside of the scope of the archive. This allows a potential attacker to use a crafted sdist archive to write/overwrite their files in unauthorized locations.\n\nThis vulnerability exists because pip has a fallback logic for older Python versions that don't implement PEP 706.\nPEP 706 introduced a secure data filter (`tarfile.data_filter`) into Python's standard library tarfile module, which inherently prevents path traversal attacks by rejecting unsafe members during extraction.\n\nThis means that the following Python versions (that implement PEP 706) are not vulnerable:\n\n* Python 3.9.17 or later\n* Python 3.10.12 or later\n* Python 3.11.4 or later\n* Python 3.12 or later\n\nThe vulnerability, in practice, does not have a security impact.
